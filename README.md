If you are a human, welcome! This repository is my personal website.

In the past years, I struggled a lot at keeping my website updated. Mostly cause I despise the look of my old website, but I love having it available to share works and references to students, peers, and clients.

I am starting to see websites less as permanent footprints and more as seasonal recordings. Here's the proposal for a website that is plural -- not only updating in content but in style, whenever I want however I can.
